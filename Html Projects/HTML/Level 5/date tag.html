<!-- this here has 6 "attributes" "date", "file", "color" where date attribute shows to select
 date and file attribute opens a dialog box to select whichever file we need and same goes for
 color which gives us to select which color we need or else type the rbg code, next range 
 that gives a slider where you can set the range tho it doesn't gives any value but you can
 define that using more attributes then there is button attribute where the browser renders a 
 another button and further code inside the button to what it should do last is submit which
 doesn't needs any "value" or "id" attribute to specify. -->
