                <h2>Wuthering Waves</h2>
            <article>Wuthering Waves[b] is a 2024 free-to-play open world action role-playing game developed and published by Kuro Games.

             First revealed on March 23, 2022, it was initially inspired by Death Stranding with the aim to create a post-apocalyptic world where players can experience the fusion of new and old civilizations. The game development also draws inspiration from various sources, including Punishing: Gray Raven for its combat mechanics, as well as the Pok√©mon games for its echo system.[1][2] Wuthering Waves has been compared to other titles of the genre such as Genshin Impact, but aims to place greater emphasis on its combat system compared to its predecessors.[3] The game was released for Android, iOS and Windows devices on May 23 (May 22 in the United States), 2024 followed by PlayStation 5 in January 2025, and macOS in March 2025.
