                I enjoy a diverse range of activities that keep me both mentally engaged and physically active. Playing video games sharpens my strategic thinking and reflexes, while reading manhwas and comics fuels my imagination and storytelling appreciation. I'm passionate about continuous learning, often exploring new topics and skills online to stay curious and informed. Praying is an important part of my daily routine, helping me stay grounded and focused. I also love participating in sports, which not only keeps me fit but also teaches teamwork and discipline.
